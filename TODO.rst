  Used `dub`

- [X] add msgpack as dependency

  Straight forward with `dub`.

- [X] msgpack a structure

- [ ] msgpack an iris structure

- [X] add zeromq as dependency

  easy thanks to `dub`

- [ ] ZeroMQ - open tcp endpoint

- [ ] send exampe structure iris.ping // echo.echo

- [ ] receive result

- [ ] create structure out of the result

- [ ] Zookeeper: discover a service

  At first, can put the tcp endpoint directly
